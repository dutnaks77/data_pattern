66,  @amianime05,They did such a great job I've tears in my eyes for those people who are talented and not get chosen to be idols instead these people are chosen for i don't know what reason maybe for visuals. 
67,  @common-pr1ug,"르세라핌이 팀적으로 봤을 때 보컬실력에 한해서는 다른 역량에 비해 확실히 부족하지 않을까 싶음.. 소수의 잘 부르는 멤버들과 그렇지 않은 멤버들이 티가 남..다큐나 녹음비하인드 보면 진짜 멤버들 모두 열심히 하는 게 느껴짐.., 앵콜도 성실하게 부르고..진짜 열정적인 게 느껴지는데 열심히와는 별개로 채원, 윤진 제외 가수로써 전달력 있는, 그러니까 소위 말해 아마추어와 달리 실력있는 노래실력을 가지고 있나? 라는 의문이 듬.. 카즈하는 연습생기간이 총 6개월정도이기 때문에 그 단기간에 엄청나게 출중한 재능이 있지 않는 이상 단련되고 발성 제대로 잡힌 보컬이 나오기가 쉽지 않은 게 당연한 것 같음..사쿠라는 모르겠음.., 아이즈원 때부터 진짜 열심히 노력하는 것 같은데 노래쪽으로 재능이 조금 부족한가 싶고.. 은채는 1인분을 해내지만 윤진, 채원만큼의 알맹이 있는 실력은 아닌 것 같음..아이돌은 가수잖슴.. 퍼포먼스도 빠질 수 없지만 부가적인거고.. 요즘들어 보컬실력이 완성되서 나오는 아이돌이 많이 드문 듯..음악적으로도 음원듣는데에 있어서 보컬이 제일 중요하구..르세라핌한테는 이게 과제일 듯 함"
68,  @loriiiii7886,Kazuha and Eunchae have so much potential..like damn they improved so much And i hope Sakura will gain more confident it seems like she's nervous

176,  @msj0015,"I am surprised by kazuha the most. I already know Yunjin & Chaewon are the best vocalists in Le sserafim, and Eunchae next. All 3 of them are pretty good singer, they were trained for long but Kazuha! She spent her 15 years of life doing ballad, joined as a trainee bcz she was just curious. And now, HYBE giving her hard choreo in antifragile, she slayed. They now gave her hard notes to sing in pre-chorus, she slayed it too. It's scary how fast she is improving. Despite training for short her voice is already very stable. If they train her well, she even can become main vocalist in the future."

267,  @-o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o-,"I mean, Sakura and Kazuha were clearly struggling, but they weren't horrible. The others weren't especially good, but definitely not bad. Considering they're a Hybe artist, this wasn't actually a bad encore at all. In general, from what I've heard from artists under Hybe, those that have been under them from the beginning (not those who joined under them later like Pledis and KOZ artists) tend to have a lot of weak live vocal performances (ofc there are some good singers mixed in, like Lee Hyun, JK)"

281,  @kasajo6451,"I understand that this is an encore stage and they’re enjoying their win, but at the same time, they know they have to sing live. this shows how some of them dont practice a lot. Being pretty is not everything. In the word singer, there is sing. What is a singer without having that good of a stable vocal cord. To be honest the members did improve from the first time, no offense, the shakiness of Sakuras voice when she was STANDING STILL is just shocking to me. To me it looked like they were trying hard to sound good. If you are good at singing effort needs to be put in, but it shouldn’t look like your forcing it. Not gonna lie at some point they did sound quite good. But overall if this was my singing and it was shaky like Sakuras and weak I would be disappointed in myself. Again sorry if you feel upset about this but this is my opinion and my advice to HYBE and any other company to choose people who has good vocal. It’s ok if you want them to be pretty to but I say vocal and dance skill are more important. Love Le Serrafim tho. ( Yes I know I spelled the groups name wrong)."

Don't tell they plan to continue with lackluster vocals until they reach 5years or more like they did to ... And no they don't rap that great so their vocals need to step up.  No hate to them, I'm directing my disgust to the company for not preparing them well to this. They age like normal human so they don't always need to dance so hard plus sooner or later they gonna have serious injuries with their hard choreos. Kudos to the girls and congratulations to their win."

304,  @probablynotheavenright5796,"Review:I believe Kazuha have a lot of potential. Not because she's stable or whatever. It's because, one, at 3:39 you can tell that she was very displeased with the way she sings. She also winced everytime she lost pitch. Meaning that she understands it was shit and most likely can 'hear' where the flaws lies. Two, she was trained in a very short time. Now, she seems to be getting a hang of her 'rapping voice' and stable at it. She has much more power in her dance too. Fast adaptibility and a blank canvas on top of that. Meaning, with more practice of controlling her voice she might be able to turned into a decent singer. Three, she was a ballerina. She's most likely have a great beat and rythm awareness, thats kinda part of the job. Four, star qualities. Despite being in a completely different field of performance than she was in the past, she adjusted quick, seems to have an ambitious character, and believe in herself when she does things that she 'can' do. As proven in this video, things that she can do, she did it good. Just some interesting things to point out. I just hope that she wont get discouraged by criticism and practice a lot instead. I'm looking forward to her career growth.Eunchae on the other hand, seems to not realize that she was singing kinda funny or maybe too fixated of singing well that she ended up not hearing it. She sounded unsure, and not confident. Voice is wriggly and stiff. Even Kazuha was having a fuller, more controlled voice than her most of the time. That can be improved with some practice and a lot of confidence, I think. Maybe train her ear too.Yunjin is flawless. Good execution, good confidence, good energy even when she made mistakes. Definitely not used to rapping which is fineChaewon needs more energy and maybe a little more confidence, she looked a little scared of mistakes. However, good techniques. Safe to say that Chae and Yunjin is the vocal back bone of the group.Sakura is sakura.People said that the fact that she was 11 years in the industry and still can't sing is ridiculous. Well, I beg to differ.Keep it in mind, idol in Japan is very different with Idol in SK. In Japan they focused more on fun songs, visual, synchronized dancing, and fan service. SK have been demanding their idol to be much more skilled. It's a fusion of what they do in Japan and a lot of western influence. So of course, she's seen as less skilled in SK. And her long years in the industry might be the problem. When you're used to speak and sing in a certain way for a long time, it became much more difficult to fix. So, bad singer, but we're not supposed to expect her to be beyonce. Lower ur expectation when it comes to kkura. Thats all I'm gonna say. She's still a great idol. Resilient, dilligent, fun to watch, wise, a good eldest sister to le sserafim, and genuinely love performing.I ended up writing an essay. Well, whatever. I love my fimmies so much and I'm looking forward to their future releases."

Not the best in terms of vocal strength but she sounds the best in this encore.Eunchae has some potential but goes off-key at the ends of her lines, lack of control, needs some more training.Sakura and Kazuha are very underdeveloped, shaky vocals and so often out of tune. Baffled why Kazuha has so many lines and challenging parts that she cannot pull off.This song does not even have many vocal parts and they struggle this way. Company gives them songs with a ton of rap lines instead of giving them proper vocal lessons. It's sad to see."
329,  @SerifeKoyuncu-zk3lk,2:33 perfect
330,  @michaelcorbett4236,When you sing live it's all about the monitors. They can determine how you hear yourself and the backing track. Very often you don't need to sing loud but if your monitors are too low you sing high and with more force. Same as if they are too high and you sing flat. It's actually harder for singers rather than musicians who sing because you can often hear your own instrument to balance it out. In ear monitors can be a godsend or a nuisance.

390,  @user-gp1bt4vm3r,"Clearly, Yunjin and Chaewon are the best vocalists here. But, I think Kazuha and Eunchae just needs to train her vocals to be more stable and they'll sound better. They both have decent vocal tone, but it's unstable. They need more control and should work on that. And, I hate to say it, but Sakura really needs to improve. This is NOT a hate comment either. It's just the truth of it. This is the very reason why she doesn't get much lines, no matter how much people try to call it ""mistreatment."" If she had stable vocals and still got small parts, then, we can call it mistreatment. But, that's not the case. Her part isn't vocal intensive at all, but you can clearly see how much she struggles. Overprotective fans used to say that it's because her parts aren't not in her ""deep voice"" range. Well, they got her to rap in a more comfortable lower pitch and you still see the result of that."

423,  @user-gp1bt4vm3r,"Sakura's solo stans need to realize that she's just not cut out to be a singer. There is no amount of training from any vocal teacher that can improve her singing abilities. It might sound harsh, but that's the truth of it. She just doesn't have the vocal chords for it. Even, her regular speaking voice is shaky. That's not going to transition well into singing.And, also stop deflecting those criticisms by saying that she's hard worker and how she's improved in dancing, desperate for positive feedback and try to shift the focus. The focus is her vocals. No one's talking about her as a person. You can't always baby her and sugarcoat everything.But, I think that Kazuha has room for improvement. She has decent sounding vocal tone, but lacks range + control. If she can improve on that, she could actually sound pretty decent and stable, at the very least. She also doesn't have that typical Japanese nasal tone.Eunchae is about the same as Kazuha. But, her vocals sound flat and emotionless. If she can improve on getting some range, control, and emotion, I think she can sound pretty decent as well. Obviously, vocally, Yunjin and Chaewon are carrying this group. Nothing more to be said there."

598,  @Tiredchimken,"Kpop stans are so disappointing and this has never changed. I completely agree the girls need to improve their vocals, especially when this is their second comeback already. Criticism can’t be avoided here I know but why they received more criticism compared to boy groups? Let me say one boy group that had a comeback around the same time also has bad encores despite debuting before le sserafim. No hate to them, I just need to bring an example since both have bad encores but received different amounts of criticism. The girls' vocals are weak but still better at hitting the right notes while the boys' vocals are weak and struggled hitting notes. In short, those boys are worst than the girls. Then why le sserafim get more hate? I’m so tired of how misogynistic kpop stans are. Boys can have bad vocals and yall would still praise them like they’re gods but when the girls slightly miss one note y’all will be criticizing them like they are the worst singers in the world. Boy group bad encores are full of love like “they deserve wins!” “They’ve improved a lot.” or “[member’s name] sings so well.” (Even though they struggled and sang so badly lol. Girl group bad encores are full of hate even they’ve done a lot better.I don’t even stan them but the difference is terrible. Where’s the fairness? What’s funny is that most kpop stans are women and you guys still do this. It’s okay to praise your favs. There’s nothing wrong with that. But if you want to criticize girl groups so badly, don’t forget to criticize your boys’ unforgivably awful vocals too alright?"

Same can be said about Lisa of BP & Momo of twice they contribute to the dance factor of the group and aren't strong vocalist themselves. Yall just wanna hate."

And then when those same idols receive more important parts, the same ones who blame the company for quote-unquote not giving fair line distribution start wondering why such challenging parts are given to those idols. Like, choose what you want or just trust the company and idols' choice maybe?? Unless the idol really doesn't have more than 30 seconds in a 4 min song, sometimes there is a reason why some idols have fewer parts. Maybe it's because of their vocal ability or maybe their voice doesn't really suit the song. There are really a lot of factors as to why some idols have fewer parts. Yes, there are some really awful line distributions but again have some thoughts on it before bashing"

714,  @yoon2397,그냥 노래는 채원이랑 윤진이가 많이 하고 은채도 나름 연습 조금만 더하면 잘할 것 같음..즈하도 랩은 생각보다 되게 잘하는 것 같고 엄청 또박또박 하려는 느낌? 즈하는 노래는 아니고 랩만  주는게 맞는것 같고..사쿠라는 그냥 연습을 많이 해야될 것 같음

716,  @angiet94,"I remember commenting on a TikTok video where a person posted the girls when they had one of their first wins. People were judging them so hard, saying mean and nasty things. You could see they were very nervous and were far away from being perfect, and I said they are just rookies, they have plenty of time to practice. And they have. This is a great performance, not perfect but definitely proud of them and how far they;ve come "

801,  @demipham595,Sakura did really worry so much about her singing. She couldn’t smile before her rap part and the anxiety really affect her voice a lot. She couldn’t get to the right tone and she knew it right away (her face looked like she was about to cry at that point. My poor Sakura ) and I can hear her voice shaking clearly. I feel so bad for Sakura as I usually lost my voice whenever I feel anxious too.I think she put a lot of pressure and expectation on herself which caused her extreme nervousness and anxiety on stage.I’m sure in a more relaxing environment she can nail her parts well. Hope she can actually enjoy singing live again.

1044,  @prodbyflee1293,Why are yall acting so dumb? They won a award . They are obviously happy and they must be not ready for singing yet and obviously yunjin and chaewon can sing better cuz they were opera singers ffs. Sakura and kazuha are japanese it takes time for people to get used to other languages. And as for eunchae she was just perfect. Instead of criticizing why not show them some support. Theyre really doing a good job tbh. And for a fact they are winning awards while ur sitting in ur parents house commenting this.  Idk why yall are hating on this so much. I found other encore perfomances good and they were actually singing nicely. Just one performance and yall acting as if it was a bad decision for them to debut.And as for sakura and kazuha yall can clearly understand their japanese because of their accentIm sure we all know they are working hardSorry if i wrote so much Its just thatThey are working hardJust appreciate and motivate them and im sure they will come back better than before
1045,  @areqqq,You can't even defend them. Kazuha and Sakura are just not strong at all. They should try their hardest from now on and we will support them for that. But seriously..

1101,  @bunnybun2945,"I just seriously don't understand why PPL are being so mean , I'm not a fan of this group and I'm not even defending them. Isn't it so obvious? Sometimes big celebrities like Taylor and Dua lipa ,Justin Bieber,BTS they also can't sing properly,their voice get cracked, it's a very normal thing . If BTS would have done that ,ppl would be like "" I can't see I'm blind"", just because they are new 4th gen kpop idols and getting immense amount of hate. Instead of cursing and hating them we should really encourage them so they can further do better. Picking someone and saying she/ he's talentless is too mean . They are human being too ,they can make mistakes,and it's very obvious. Isn't it? They are idols they do a lot hardwork more than what you think. Some of them might need little bit of improvement but that doesn't make them talentless."

1393,  @user-rw2rw9ct2u,라이브 존나 못한다고 해서 봤는데 생각보다 잘함. 솔직히 트와이스보단 훨씬 낫고1. 허윤진 : cd를 씹어삼키는 수준은 아니지만 적당적당히 잘함. 실제 쌩라이브로 이정도만 해도 평타침. 발성이나 라이브실력이 살짝 불안한 감이 있는 정도2. 홍은채 : 존나 못하는줄 알았는데 발성이나 음정이나 생각보다 준수함.3. 김채원 : 가장 잘하는건 맞는것 같고 끝처리 이런것도 깔끔한데 너무 여유 있는척을 함4. 카즈하 : 여러모로 어설픈게 있긴 하나 live ar보다 더 매력적임. 못하지만 존나 매력있다 정도?? 짧은 연습기간과 성장가능성을 보면 발전가능성 가장 높다고 봄. 라이브를 하는 태도자체가 솔직 담백하게 해서 더 매력적인 것 같기도 함5. 사쿠라 : 앵콜라이브 논란의 원흉. 라이브 실력을 둘째치고 기본적으로 음정도 못맞춤. 모모 다현보다 살짝 나은정도임. 10년간 이 바닥에 있으면서 외모와 캐릭터성으로 버텨왔나 싶을정도로 본질적은 측면에서 의구심이 들게 만들게 하는데 그래도 고무적인건 적어도 뺑기는 치지 않아서 좋음2세대 여돌이나 에스파가 라이브를 존나 잘하는거임. 4세대 기준으로 그리 못하는 편은 아님(엔믹스는 동방 천상지희 급으로 넘겨야함)
